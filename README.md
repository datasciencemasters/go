Note from the [Editor](): `Take Two`

<sup>In the old days of 2013, the OSDSM was born. Then, there were "little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist." (_David Hardtke, Nov 2012_) Since then, history has witnessed a few things...</sup>

<sup>• Data Scientists working across industries and the world</sup><br />
<sup>• social media manipulated to disrupt elections</sup><br />
<sup>• BLM and #metoo</sup><br />
<sup>• machine learning begins falling to engineering</sup><br />
<sup>• a pandemic</sup><br />
<sup>• climate change disasters becoming very frequent</sup><br />
<sup>• remote work becomes normal</sup>

<sup>In that decade, Data Science has seen growth of jobs, shortfall of goals, success in many industries, abject failure in others, and nefarious use cases. In particular, [adverse consequences and complications of learning from data](http://machinebias.org) appear in too many examples: [elections undermined by psychographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), [dismal gender (Men=74%) and BIPOC diversity in the AI field](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html), a revived [eugenics](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612275/sociogenomics-is-opening-a-new-door-to-eugenics/), an [explainability crisis](https://hbr.org/2018/07/when-is-it-important-for-an-algorithm-to-explain-itself), [facial recognition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/facial-recognition-technology-identity-tesco-ethical-issues) used to [identify people](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1278) and systematically [detain them](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims), ["aggression" detection microphones in schools](https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/), and many others. It has never been more clear that **we need to talk about the real world impacts of our work, and consider how our creations are used.** A prescient [novel](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf) grappled with considering what you birth.</sup>

<sup>Like any tool, data-driven technologies are indifferent to the morality of their ends. Perhaps the greatest risk of all is leaving this tool in the hands of the few expensively-educated people who cannot possibly represent all of us. To balance this, open source movements seek to lower the barriers to education for everyone. Data science and data literacy must be widespread, accessible, and leveraged for building our collective future. More than ever, we need that future to be built by members of society who are diverse and focused on generative, resilient solutions. After all, the things we build are mirrors of ourselves (seriously, read Shelley's [Frankenstein](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf).</sup>

> <sup>_Computers reflect the biases and belief systems of the people programming them_ -[@alicegoldfuss](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1016034359134941184)</sup>

<sup>The OSDSM is built with the belief that **open source education enables the possibility for a diverse, collective, generative future-building.** I hope that you are one of the next Data Scientists to make a difference in the world by helping us all make better decisions with the scientific process and critical thinking. This rewritten curriculum focuses on what is needed to be successful in the entry-level role, but I hope it extends far beyond that.</sup>

## The Open Source Data Science Masters

The open-source curriculum for learning to be a Data Scientist. Curriculum resources from both universities and working Data Scientists focuses on foundational theory and applied skills. The OSDSM is collectively-maintained and open to PRs.

The goal of this curriculum is to prepare the student for an entry level Data Scientist role, using open source materials, at no cost. Books not offered for free are often available through a public library, indicated here with current list price. The Masters is self-guided and self-accredited. To better support credibility, the structure now includes a Capstone project intended to demonstrate the student's problem solving approach, skills in execution, and communication. Upon completion, the student can award oneself a [Credential](https://help.accredible.com/add-your-credential-to-linkedin) on LinkedIn from the Open Source Data Science Masters.

This is called a "Masters" because it is primarily geared toward learners with some college-level education in mathematics, programming, economics, or related disciplines. Come as you are!

## 🤝 Doing Data Science
_Learn about how doing science with others and for businesses can work._

### What is the job?

In ideal terms, a Data Scientist advises strategic decision-making using data-backed analysis and tested hypotheses. YMMV as this depends on the company needs and the team being supported.

* What Professional Data Scientists Actually Do [Video](https://youtu.be/iPdO9MwdcLE)
* The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists [Book ```$25```](http://amzn.to/1J7lILJ)
* Required reading about whether machine learning is always the best tool for the job. [Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf)

### Communication and Teamwork

For a Data Scientist's work to be impactful, they must be effective at communicating their work and findings. In any setting, clear logic and effective business writing are crucial to reaching your audience. And of course, doing Data Science with a team over zoom is different from being in person in an office. There is much more written communication and asynchronous consumption of content in the remote office environment. More than ever, writing and communication skills are crucial to being an effective Data Scientist for yourself and your team.

* LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively [UChicago / Video](https://buomsoo-kim.github.io/learning/2020/03/30/Craft-of-writing-effectively.md/). Recommend watching this twice and taking notes.

#### A note on teams
In the modern organization, it is very rare that a Data Scientist works in isolation. Communicating the value of the work being done is crucial to getting buy-in from partners whose decisions and operations depend on your work. Those partners might be:
- Product Managment
- Engineering
- Design (User Experience, Research, Product)
- Operations (Project Management, Customer Service Agents, Data Management)
- Marketing
- Finance Operations
- etc.

Typically, the more clearly you are able to communicate the "why", the **value of what you are doing**, the more these teams will be able to support you and your work in conversations you may not be a part of. Even if others don't understand "how" you do your work (which is very important to you and your manager!), they will be able to understand and repeat a well-communicated "why". This is why we write Specs, to get buy-in and allow for questions or input, before the work starts.

#### The Spec
A document conveying the motives, direction, investment, and expected value of the work.

* Goal / "Why" -- What is the point of this work? What decision is the organization trying to make?
* Impact -- What decisions might be made differently as a result of this work? What is the expected value?
* Data -- What evidence will this draw on?
* Assumptions -- What evidence does not exist? What assumptions are necessary or agreed upon?
* Methods / "How" -- Overview methods expected to be used. Analysis, with what tools? Experimentation, with what methodology?
* Results -- (to be filled in as completed)

#### Results Presentation
A slide deck or document with the goal of conveying the results of the work and how the findings support an important decision(s).

Best appended to the Spec, and summarized in a slide deck for easy consumption. Depending on the culture of the group, slides or a short docuemnt may be easier to look through to understand the results of the work. In the remote work era, think about how your work will be passed around and make sure your "above the fold" is easy to understand and clearly conveys the "why" and results in particular.

__Example__: A particularly polished [presentation](https://medium.com/lyft-engineering/how-lyft-discovered-openstreetmap-is-the-freshest-map-for-rideshare-a7a41bf92ec) of results of our [study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sb-dOUjeP1Ljqz4ra931D3Pe8B5C3pde/view) on map quality, which caused the company to decide against buying a commercially available annual license. The impact of this work was a) increased confidence in service reliability and b) saved company ~$10mi/yr.

## 🧑‍💻 Capstone Project
_Choose a meaningful project or dataset to demonstrate what you've learned._

### Pick a dataset that you care about
* The very detailed [data is plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)
* Collection of [datasets](http://bit.ly/osdsm-datasets-link)

### Formulate a Hypothesis & Write a Spec
Review the earlier reading on [The Scientific Process](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymaker-psychology/chapter/reading-the-scientific-process-replace-content/). Formulate a clear, concise hypothesis. This is the headliner of your [Spec](#the-spec), flesh that out.

### Show your work + explain why you chose this project (Case Presentation)
 * [Data Science in IPython Notebooks](http://bit.ly/ipynb-ds) (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, K-Means Clustering)

### Graduate!
1. Create a document or github repo showcasing the list of courses and materials you completed. Include your project materials. Also recommended: include a personal statement about why you chose this course of study and what you seek to do with it.
2. Award yourself a [Credential](https://help.accredible.com/add-your-credential-to-linkedin) on LinkedIn from _The Open Source Data Science Masters_, with a link to the documentation you created.
3. Congratulations! 🎉

#### `Take Two` Change Log
1. Restructured ala the [2022 Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iSlwSG6F57URqIl47KUmEJCtvS_x4Uxp71caY0-wp8/edit#slide=id.g1196d9e5821_0_0).
2. Pruned broken links. It's been a while, and some of these resources have moved -- or worse -- been taken down.
3. Pared down links to a more opinionated list.
4. Proceeds. [Bookshop.org](http://bookshop.org) links for all books, which supports independent bookshops with commissions. Since the first commits in 2014, I have donated any related commissions to [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/), which was one of the few healthcare providers in my community growing up and is the largest single provider of reproductive health services in the US. Though donations should flow to independent bookshops from now on, my personal commitment to PP remains.
