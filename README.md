## The Open-Source Data Science Masters

### The Internet is Your Oyster

I didn't want to wait. I wanted to work on things I care about **now**. Why sleep through grad school lectures tomorrow when you can hack on interesting questions today?

*see [my transcript](http://bit.ly/corthelldata)*

With Coursera, ebooks, Stack Overflow, and GitHub -- all free and open -- how can you afford not to take advantage of an open source education?

### The Motivation

We need more Data Scientists.

> ...by 2018 the United States will experience a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists, and 1.5 million managers and analysts capable of reaping actionable insights from the big data deluge.

-- [McKinsey Report Highlights the Impending Data Scientist Shortage](http://blog.gopivotal.com/news-2/mckinsey-report-highlights-the-impending-data-scientist-shortage) 23 July 2013

> There are little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist.

-- David Hardtke [How To Hire A Data Scientist](http://blog.bright.com/2012/11/13/how-to-hire-a-data-scientist/) 13 Nov 2012

### An Academic Shortfall

Classic academic conduits aren't providing Data Scientists -- this talent gap will be closed differently.

> **Academic credentials are important but not necessary for high-quality data science.** The core aptitudes – curiosity, intellectual agility, statistical fluency, research stamina, scientific rigor, skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are widely distributed throughout the population.

> We’re likely to see more uncredentialed, inexperienced individuals try their hands at data science, **bootstrapping their skills on the open-source ecosystem and using the diversity of modeling tools available.** Just as data-science platforms and tools are proliferating through the magic of open source, big data’s data-scientist pool will as well.

> And there’s yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap: the democratization of data science. While I agree wholeheartedly with Raden’s statement that “the crème-de-la-crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia, technology vendors, Wall Street, research and government,” I think he’s understating the extent to which **autodidacts – the self-taught, uncredentialed, data-passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations’ data science initiatives.**

### Notation
Paid books, courses, and resources are noted with ```$```.

### A Note About Direction
This is an introduction geared toward those with at least **a minimum understanding of programming**, and (perhaps obviously) an interest in the components of Data Science (like statistics and distributed computing).
Out of personal preference and need for focus, I geared the original curriculum toward **Python tools and resources**. R resources can be found [here](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go/blob/master/r-resources.md).
