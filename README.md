Note from the [Editor](http://clarecorthell.org): `Take Two`

<sup>In the old days of 2013, the OSDSM was born. Then, there were "little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist." (_David Hardtke, Nov 2012_) Since then, history has witnessed many things, including:</sup>

<sup>‚Ä¢ Data Scientists working across industries and the world</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ social media manipulation disrupts many elections</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ BLM and #metoo and Extinction Rebellion and many other social movements</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ machine learning begins falling under engineering domain</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ a pandemic</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ climate change disasters becoming very frequent while climate warms faster than predicted</sup><br />
<sup>‚Ä¢ remote work becoming common</sup>
<sup>‚Ä¢ multiple global recession shocks</sup>

<sup>In that decade, Data Science has seen growth of jobs, shortfall of goals, success in many industries, abject failure in others, and nefarious use cases. In particular, [adverse consequences and complications of learning from data](http://machinebias.org) appear in too many examples: [elections undermined by psychographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), [dismal gender (Men=74%) and BIPOC diversity in the AI field](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html), a revived [eugenics](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612275/sociogenomics-is-opening-a-new-door-to-eugenics/), an [explainability crisis](https://hbr.org/2018/07/when-is-it-important-for-an-algorithm-to-explain-itself), [facial recognition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/facial-recognition-technology-identity-tesco-ethical-issues) used to [identify people](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1278) and systematically [detain them](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims), ["aggression" detection microphones in schools](https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/), and many others. It has never been more clear that **we need to talk about the real world impacts of our work, and consider how our creations are used.** As you consider this, read a prescient [novel](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf) that grapples with the consequences of birthing, of creation, of technology.</sup>

<sup>Like any tool, data-driven technologies are indifferent to the morality of their ends. Perhaps the greatest risk of all is leaving this tool in the hands of the few expensively-educated people who cannot possibly represent all of us. To balance this, open source movements seek to lower the barriers to education for everyone. Data science and data literacy must be widespread, accessible, and leveraged for building our collective future. More than ever, we need that future to be built by members of society who are diverse and focused on generative, sustainable, resilient, [emergent](https://bookshop.org/a/2958/9781849352604) solutions. After all, the things we build are mirrors of ourselves (seriously, read Shelley's [Frankenstein](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf)).</sup>

> <sup>_Computers reflect the biases and belief systems of the people programming them_ -[@alicegoldfuss](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1016034359134941184)</sup>

<sup>The OSDSM is built with the belief that **open source education makes a diverse, collective, generative future-building possible.** I hope that you are one of the next people -- whether you call yourself a Data Scientist or not -- to help make better decisions with the scientific process, critical thinking, and everything else your unique perspective brings to the table. This rewritten curriculum focuses on what is needed to be successful in the entry-level role, but that is just a generic outline; truly, I hope where you take it extends far beyond that.</sup>

## The Open Source Data Science Masters

The open-source curriculum for learning to be a Data Scientist. Curriculum resources from both universities and working Data Scientists focuses on foundational theory and applied skills. The OSDSM is collectively-maintained and open to PRs.

The goal of this curriculum is to prepare the student for an entry level Data Scientist role, using open source materials, at no cost but with the same calibur of materials found in the most reputable paid programs. Books not offered for free are often available through a public library, also indicated here with current list price. The Masters is self-guided and self-accredited. To better support credibility, the structure now includes a Capstone project intended to demonstrate the student's problem solving approach, skills in execution, and communication. Upon completion, the student can award oneself a [Credential](https://help.accredible.com/add-your-credential-to-linkedin) on LinkedIn from the Open Source Data Science Masters. As with all things, the OSDSM is best played as a team sport (try finding people on [r/learndatascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/learndatascience/)).

This is called a "Masters" because it is primarily concerned with "upper-level" college course material in mathematics, programming, economics, or related disciplines. Come as you are!

### What is Data Science?
One could argue that "Data Science" is a recent term for an already existing information analysis discipline. Humans instinctually search for patterns, a purpose we also see in this more digitized discipline. Read different sources (and search beyond this list) about the uses of data science.
- The Signal and The Noise / Nate Silver [Book ```$18```](https://bookshop.org/a/2958/9780143125082) -- Narrated cases of Data Science at play in the real world.
- Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking) / Christian Rudder [Book ```$17```](https://bookshop.org/a/2958/9780385347396) -- From the inside of OKCupid, real examples of how data science can illustrate human behavior.
- Informatics of the Oppressed / Rodrigo Ochigame [Logic Magazine](https://logicmag.io/care/informatics-of-the-oppressed/) -- _Algorithms of oppression have been around for a long time. So have radical projects to dismantle them and build emancipatory alternatives._
 * A showcase of [Jupyter Python Data Analysis Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki) across disciplines.

### Foundations of Data Science

#### Problem Solving
When there are no answers in the back of the book, how do you proceed? Breaking down problems is a skill, one that can and should be learned. Follow P√≥lya's process, and for extra credit, seek out resources on computer science [decomposition](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~libs111/files/lectures/unit1-3.pdf).
 * Problem-Solving Heuristics "How To Solve It" George P√≥lya [Berkeley / Summary](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) [Book ```$18```](https://bookshop.org/a/2958/9780691164076)

### The Scientific Process & Experimentation
It is crucial as a Data Scientist that you show integrity in and transparency of scientific process. Even if you've been here before, review and draw out the process diagram for the scientific method.

### Communication and Teamwork

For a Data Scientist's work to be impactful, they must be effective at communicating their work and findings. In any setting, clear logic and effective business writing are crucial to reaching your audience. And of course, doing Data Science with a team over zoom is different from being in person in an office. There is much more written communication and asynchronous consumption of content in the remote office environment. More than ever, writing and communication skills are crucial to being an effective Data Scientist for yourself and your team.

* LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively [UChicago / Video](https://buomsoo-kim.github.io/learning/2020/03/30/Craft-of-writing-effectively.md/). Recommend watching this twice and taking notes.

#### The Data Scientist works in a Team
In the modern organization, it is very rare that a Data Scientist works in isolation. Communicating the value of the work being done is crucial to getting buy-in from partners whose decisions and operations depend on your work. Those partners might be:
- Product Managment
- Engineering
- Design (User Experience, Research, Product)
- Operations (Project Management, Customer Service Agents, Data Management)
- Marketing
- Finance Operations
- etc.

Typically, the more clearly you are able to communicate the "why", the **value of what you are doing**, the more these teams will be able to support you and your work in conversations you may not be a part of. Even if others don't understand "how" you do your work (which is very important to you and your manager!), they will be able to understand and repeat a well-communicated "why". This is why we write Specs, to get buy-in and allow for questions or input, before the work starts.

#### The Spec
A document conveying the motives, direction, investment, and expected value of the work.

* Goal / "Why" -- What is the point of this work? What decision is the organization trying to make?
* Impact -- What decisions might be made differently as a result of this work? What is the expected value?
* Data -- What evidence will this draw on?
* Assumptions -- What evidence does not exist? What assumptions are necessary or agreed upon?
* Methods / "How" -- Overview methods expected to be used. Analysis, with what tools? Experimentation, with what methodology?
* Results -- (to be filled in as completed)

#### Results Presentation
A slide deck or document with the goal of conveying the results of the work and how the findings support an important decision(s).

Best appended to the Spec, and summarized in a slide deck for easy consumption. Depending on the culture of the group, slides or a short document may be easier to look through to understand the results of the work. In the remote work era, think about how your work will be passed around and make sure your "above the fold" is easy to understand and clearly conveys the "why" and results in particular.

__Example__: A particularly polished [presentation](https://medium.com/lyft-engineering/how-lyft-discovered-openstreetmap-is-the-freshest-map-for-rideshare-a7a41bf92ec) of [map quality study results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sb-dOUjeP1Ljqz4ra931D3Pe8B5C3pde/view) showing higher data quality in US maps on OSM than commercially available alternatives.  The impact of this work was a) increased confidence in service reliability for the company and b) enabled the company to decide against buying a commercially available annual license costing millions of dollars annually.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Capstone Project
_Choose a meaningful project or dataset to demonstrate what you've learned._

### Pick a dataset that you care about
* The very detailed [data is plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)
* Collection of [datasets](http://bit.ly/osdsm-datasets-link)

### Formulate a Hypothesis & Write a Spec
Review the earlier reading on [The Scientific Process](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymaker-psychology/chapter/reading-the-scientific-process-replace-content/). Formulate a clear, concise hypothesis. This is the headliner of your [Spec](#the-spec), flesh that out.

### Show your work + Explain why you chose this project
Show the process you used to disprove your hypothesis, preferably in a jupyter notebook. See [examples](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki) to get a taste of how you can showcase your work.

### Graduate!
1. Create a document or github repo showcasing the list of courses and materials you completed. Include your project materials. Also recommended: include a personal statement about why you chose this course of study and what you seek to do with it.
2. Award yourself a [Credential](https://help.accredible.com/add-your-credential-to-linkedin) on LinkedIn from _The Open Source Data Science Masters_, with a link to the documentation you created.
3. Congratulations! üéâ

#### `Take Two` Change Log
1. Restructured ala the [2022 Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iSlwSG6F57URqIl47KUmEJCtvS_x4Uxp71caY0-wp8/edit#slide=id.g1196d9e5821_0_0).
2. Pruned broken links. It's been a while, and some of these resources have moved -- or worse -- been taken down.
3. Pared down links to a more opinionated list.
4. Proceeds. [Bookshop.org](http://bookshop.org) links for all books, which supports independent bookshops with commissions. Since the first commits in 2014, I have donated any related commissions to [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/), which was one of the few healthcare providers in my community growing up and is the largest single provider of reproductive health services in the US. Though donations should flow to independent bookshops from now on, my personal commitment to PP remains.
