**OpenSource Data Science Masters Curriculum**<br>
Below is a planned curriculum that I'm looking to follow. As with life, I'm not expecting it to be followed linearly necessarily. And I may swap courses in and out as interesting things arise. 
I do plan to take at least one element from all of the recommended themes published in the OpenSource Data Science masters. And I'm favouring online courses as it's obviously easier to stay honest with regards to progress over reading a book and claiming that you know the subject matter.

<h2>Recognised openSource curriculum</h2>
<h3>Base Introduction</h3>
Data Science Introductions
 - [ ] Intro to Data Science by UW / Coursera, online course
 - [ ] Data Science by Harvard, online course
 - [ ] Data Science with Open Source Tools, book

Distributed Computing Paradigms
 - [ ] Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce by Cloudera and Udacity 
*Note: I might swap the above course with an EdX course on Apache Spark and distributed computing*

Databases

**OpenSource Data Science Masters Capstone Project**
I would like to do a capstone project focused on using big data to understand workplace dynamics, and more appropriate hiring decisions. E.g. can we use big data to better understand an employees cultural fit? 
As I progress through the curriculum, I'll better define the capstone project.

If you'd like to pair up for the capstone, [let me know](http://www.twitter.com/byrnenick)
