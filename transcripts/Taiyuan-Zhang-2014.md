### Brief Intro
Machine learning and data mining. Large-scale data processing.  

### Education
**Carnegie Mellon University**, Pittsburgh, PA     Dec. 2015(Expected)  
Master of Computational Data Science(\textit{Analytic}), School of Computer Science  
Selected Courses: Machine Learning, Search Engine, Cloud Computing, Multimedia DB \& Data Mining  

**Tsinghua University**, Beijing, China  
Bachelor of Computer Software, School of Software   

### Experience
1.  Internship@Hulu
2.  Earliest member of A technology startup

### Projects
#### Multi-Task Recursive Neural Network(10701 Machine Learning Project)}    
1.  Implemented parser to transform training data into sematic tree required by the algorithm  
2.  Implemented and tuned stochastic gradient descent and multi-task learning (with \emph{Python, Scipy})  


#### Twitter Data Analysis    
1.  Implemented \emph{Extract-Transform-Load} of twitter data with AWS Streaming Map Reduce.   
2.  Configured MySQL/Hbase to store and index needed data  
3.  Implemented and optimized web service with \emph{Undertow} framework in Java  


#### Non-negative Matrix Factorization based Transfer Learning  
1.  Designed and implemented a program that can automatically download news documents with categories through RSS from major news websites  
2.  Developed a program to automatically extract information from heterogeneous Chinese news webpages  
3.  Designed and implemented a new transfer learning algorithm based on NMF. The algorithm achieves better results in different transfer learning datasets (including a text dataset collected as described above) than state-of-art common subspace learning methods
